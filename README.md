# AceScripts
Scripts and specific analyses for ACE

These scripts rely on the aceR package, which you can find [here](https://github.com/josegallegos07/aceR)

Installation:

1. Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/)
2. Install git. On mac, simply open your Terminal app, and type `git` on the command line and press enter. Your computer will then walk you through the steps to install it.
3. In the command line, navigate to the folder which you want to `AceScripts` to live. For example, `cd ~/Desktop`
4. Run `git clone https://github.com/gazzlab/AceScripts.git` This will create a new AceScripts folder in the directory you're in
5. Open `AceScripts.Rproj` in RStudio
6. Install the `aceR` library. Run these 2 instructions in the R console:
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("josegallegos07/aceR")
```

Running:

* Whenever you make a change within the `R` folder, make sure you run `Build and Reload` under the `Build` menu before running code
* There is a `test_script.R` in the `scripts` folder, this is expecting to run on Seacrest data that sits on the Desktop. TODO: Add in some example/dummy data within the project so anyone can have a sanity check run without having to need a particular data set in some particular folder on their computer
